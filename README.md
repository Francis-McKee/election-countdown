I wanted to create a tool for this 2024 election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.
I originally started developing this tool in October before the election but stopped development because I didn't think it was worthy of being a **"portfolio project"** (insert jazz hands).
Anyways, eventually I continued working on it and decided to post it now in November, one day before the election. Not very helpful, I know.
That's what happens when you focus on your content (in whatever field) being perfect, you end up not posting anything. 
At the very least maybe it can help someone decide who to vote for.
And I can resuse it for future elections, with enough time in advance for people to actually use it :D
